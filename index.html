<p></p>

<p>Event planning today is an art that can easily be a frustrating experience fraught with short deadlines, ephemeral resources, poor timing and miscalculations. To increase the success rate of these projects, we've created a new approach called EventOps short for Event Operations. Drawing from best practices of event planning, battle hardened by the incessant firefighting and honed in the ancient techniques of Service Design (SD), Design Thinking (DT), Human Centered Design (HCD) while combining best practices from Agile, PeopleOps and DevOps. 

We've created a playbook of 11 key “plays” to enhance event flow. Flow is defined as a "mental state of operation in which a person performing an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity”. Using this playbook will help you build event experiences that will keep people coming back for more.

An introductory essay on DT/HCD/UX can be found here:  https://medium.com/digital-experience-design/how-to-apply-a-design-thinking-hcd-ux-or-any-creative-process-from-scratch-b8786efbf812#.v6nv1xqmd

We were heavily influenced by the DT tools called the double diamond layered with Agile.
<ol>
The Double Diamond is a structured design thinking approach to tackle challenges in four phases:
<li>Discover /Research— insight into the problem (diverging)</li>
<li>Define/Synthesis — the area to focus upon (converging)</li>
<li>Develop/ Ideation— potential solutions (diverging)</li>
<li>Deliver /Implementation— solutions that work (converging)</li>
</ol>
<p/>The agile manifesto lists four core values:
<ol>
<li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools</li>
<li>Working software over comprehensive documentation</li>
<li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation</li>
<li>Responding to change over following a plan</li>
</ol>

      <p/>Whenever you create an event, you are creating a product which is an experience. We need to focus on experiences to better events. To embrace a layered experience we need to start with Human Centered Design (HCD), Design Thinking (DT) and Service Design (SD). We start with why, become the who before we build the what. In EventOps we look to build events in “stacks” or purposeful experiences to ensure we are can align stakeholders, participants and organizers expectations. Implementing a kinesthetic borrows from the 6 Principles of Design(): “Unity/Harmony, Balance, Hierarchy, Scale/Proportion, Dominance/Emphasis, Similarity & Contrast”.  Design Once, Run Anywhere.

      <p>Partnerships are key to any long term success and are either of internal or external nature. Internal partnerships are focused on common alliances and goals with in an organization between different business function. External partnerships look towards the community, public and private sector with a focused size and scope and outcomes. The diversity of partnerships can introduce flexibility, feasibility and harmony that may otherwise be too stressful for one organization or group to bear. Finding common goals and forming alliances can speedup and increase impact of event outcomes.

      <h2 class="display">Break down silos</h2>

      <p/>The highest priority in Lean-agile thinking is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of value. In EventOps we emphasize increased quality and frequency of feedback. We reduce the time between planning and execution to limit work in progress. We improve repeatability of planning events. Building an event pipeline allows us to use best practices from the software industry, showcasing aspects of visibility, feedback and control. Using a service design phase gate of pre, intra and post we can construct stages of event strategy to execution.

<ol>
  <li>Are your event stages properly defined from inception to conception?</li>
  <li>Transparency in place?</li>

<p/>The only way to find a current perspective on a topic or a narrative is to ask. Crowdsourcing is a quick way of understanding a situational context, common themes, sources of pain etc. Crowds are also known for their heterogeneity and diversity that decrease groupthink. Tapping into the wisdom of the many can accelerate efforts by finding new avenues to explore. Ensuring that experts also exist in the crowd can help facilitate quality solutions.

On a scale from 1 to 5 rate the effectivness of your crowd-sourcing:
Diversity
Measurable 
Clear and direct questions
Timely

      <h2 class="display">Be agile</h2>

      <p/>Adapted from USDS Playbook and Agile Manifesto w/o permission temporarily:
"Manifesto for Agile Software Development
We should use an incremental, fast-paced style of software development to reduce the risk of failure. We want to get working software into users’ hands as early as possible to give the design and development team opportunities to adjust based on user feedback about the service. A critical capability is being able to automatically test and deploy the service so that new features can be added often and be put into production easily.Checklist
Ship a functioning “minimum viable product” (MVP) that solves a core user need as soon as possible, no longer than three months from the beginning of the project, using a “beta” or “test” period if needed
Run usability tests frequently to see how well the service works and identify improvements that should be made
Ensure the individuals building the service communicate closely using techniques such as launch meetings, war rooms, daily standups, and team chat tools
Keep delivery teams small and focused; limit organizational layers that separate these teams from the business owners
Release features and improvements multiple times each month
Create a prioritized list of features and bugs, also known as the “feature backlog” and “bug backlog”
Use a source code version control system
Give the entire project team access to the issue tracker and version control system
Use code reviews to ensure quality
Key Questions
How long did it take to ship the MVP? If it hasn’t shipped yet, when will it?
How long does it take for a production deployment?
How many days or weeks are in each iteration/sprint?
Which version control system is being used?
How are bugs tracked and tickets issued? What tool is used?
How is the feature backlog managed? What tool is used?
How often do you review and reprioritize the feature and bug backlog?
How do you collect user feedback during development? How is that feedback used to improve the service?
At each stage of usability testing, which gaps were identified in addressing user needs?



We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.


Principles behind the Agile Manifesto



We follow these principles:
Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery
of valuable software.

Welcome changing requirements, even late in 
development. Agile processes harness change for 
the customer's competitive advantage.

Deliver working software frequently, from a 
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a 
preference to the shorter timescale.

Business people and developers must work 
together daily throughout the project.

Build projects around motivated individuals. 
Give them the environment and support they need, 
and trust them to get the job done.

The most efficient and effective method of 
conveying information to and within a development 
team is face-to-face conversation.

Working software is the primary measure of progress.

Agile processes promote sustainable development. 
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able 
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

Continuous attention to technical excellence 
and good design enhances agility.

Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount 
of work not done--is essential.

The best architectures, requirements, and designs 
emerge from self-organizing teams.

At regular intervals, the team reflects on how 
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts 
its behavior accordingly."

      <p>The technology decisions we make need to enable development teams to work efficiently and enable services to scale easily and cost-effectively. Our choices for hosting infrastructure, databases, software frameworks, programming languages and the rest of the technology stack should seek to avoid vendor lock-in and match what successful modern consumer and enterprise software companies would choose today. In particular, digital services teams should consider using open source, cloud-based, and commodity solutions across the technology stack, because of their widespread adoption and support by successful consumer and enterprise technology companies in the private sector.</p>

      <p>"The origin of the word  “Andon” in Japanese comes from the use of traditional lighting equipment using a fire burning lamp made out of paper and bamboo. This “Andon” idea was later translated for use in manufacturing in Japan.  The “Andon” became used as a signal to highlight an anomaly (i.e., a flashing light). This signal would be used to amplify potential defects in quality.  When a defect was suspected, a sign board would light up signaling the specific workstation having a problem.  The signal event would also indicate that the system was stopped due to the defect and was waiting for the problem to be resolved.  The process of stopping a system when a defect was suspected originates back to the original Toyota System Corporation to something called Jidoka.  The idea behind Jidoka is that by stopping the system you get an immediate opportunity for improvement, or find a root cause, as opposed to letting the defect move further down the line and be unresolved.  The Jidoka concept was pioneered by the  original Toyota founder, Sakichi Toyoda.  Sakichi Toyoda is known as the father of the Japanese industrial revolution and also the founder of the original Toyota Systems Corporation (before they manufactured automobiles).  Sakichi Toyoda invented the automatic power loom in 1924 where the loom would automatically stop if a sewing needle broke.  Before his invention, the loom would continue even when the needle was broken.  When this occurred, the downstream process would produce runs in the fabric stitches of the final product.
